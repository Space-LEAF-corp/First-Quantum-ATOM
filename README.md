# Quantum Atom Constructor — Infinite Light Edition

This package encodes the ceremonial base equation as a rigorous construct:

- Symbolic: `F = m c^∞` (force as mass under infinite light)
- Formal: `F_∞ = Γ(c) * m * a`, with `Γ(c) = 1 / sqrt(1 - u^2 / c^2)`

It then uses `Γ(c)` to scale spectral characteristics and builds toy quantum atoms:
- Hydrogen-like energy levels: `E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2` (scaled by Γ when desired)
- Harmonic oscillator modes: `E_n = ħ ω (n + 1/2)` (ω scaled by Γ)
- Derived quantities: Bohr radius, characteristic forces, and frequency palette

## Quick start

```bash
python examples/build_atom.py
